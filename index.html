    <h2>problem statement</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.”
Rather than rambling about the history of IoT I’ll move on the much more interesting things linked wAs per Wikipedia: “The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, ith IoT. The term IoT has now become synonymous with concepts like “smart home” and “embedded systems”.
Like most recent technologies IoT is entirely dependent on MOSFET Transistors. At this point I’d like to applaud the work of Mohammad M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng. When most people think about people who influenced the industry they think about Bill Gates or Steve Jobs (or if you research maybe Paul Baran). Most people tend to forget guys like Atalla, Kahng or Gordon Moore. 

IoT usually comes with Ambient Intelligence (AmI). AmI refers to electronic systems that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of people. AmI in turn depends on pre-existing technologies like intelligent agents (IA), inter-operability, service-operated architecture. Ambient Intelligence has received enormous support from academics. (Check out MIT Project Oxygen). IoT in turn also depends on Li-Fi, NFC, RFID, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LTE, 5G, LPWAN, VSAT, Ethernet, etc. 
In recent years Machine Learning especially Deep Reinforcement Learning has been implemented in the IoT industry. This learning model is quite similar to how children usually learn stuff. This is something that I’ve noticed in the tech industry we tend to use terms and make tech like they’re related to us, almost as if they’re humans.
When we talk about implementing IoT in automation or home security we have to make the devices capable of intelligent control and decision. This intelligence acquired using ML requires a lot of processing power for data processing. This leads to two types of devices:
Machines with a lot of power. Thus, making them expensive.
Devices linked with services such as Cloud Computing. 
One of the most booming research topics in the field of IoT is integrating Deep Learning algorithms into pre-existing devices equipped with IoT capabilities.

When most of us think about IoT or computers controlling stuff we tend to think of Jarvis controlling Tony Stark or the scene in Mr. Robot where they hack the smart house of a person. Apart from being extremely funny, the scene possibly can be the future. 
Every Major company has started IoT projects like the Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple HomePod, Samsung SmartThingsHub. Even open-source projects have started like home-assistant.io or openHAB. 
Some of you might ask that: Why do we need IoT? The need according to me comes because of the innate human tendency to do more with less amount of work. IoT is going to be the driving forces in the future. All the things that we’re passionate about like connected vehicles, home automation, wearable tech. All of these things depend upon the success of IoT. 

IoT has applications in all fields of life:
Military
Consumer Market
Commercial Market
Infrastructure Services
Industrial Services
It has experienced explosive growth in the recent years due to the huge range of applications it has. All of the future technologies somehow revolve around IoT. It has penetrated every industry. 

But when you think about IoT after a while you realize that the entire industry revolves around consumer-connected data. A huge part of IoT industry requires large-scale collection of data.  A part of IoT can be used for public manipulation. This brings in government and politics and all the grotesque things that follow.
The potential vulnerability of IoT requires a lot of security to be built into the devices. As an optimist I see this as a potential for employment. When you think about the potential threats are enormous. 
A positive thing has happened since the increased awareness about privacy and information security. The Senate Bill No. 327 which went into effect on 1st January requires
“a manufacturer of a connected device, as those terms are defined, to equip the device with a reasonable security feature or features that are appropriate to the nature and function of the device, appropriate to the information it may collect, contain, or transmit, and designed to protect the device and any information contained therein from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure.”</p> <br>
    <p>1) there are many website like www.tutorialduniya.com , www.finalrevise.com 
        and quora ,they all talk about the course content and scope but this is not 
        sufficent because  after complettion of class 12 many student have not clear
        vission about what to do next even if they certain plans then they find it
        hard where to apply and when to fill forms 
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        to solve this problem we have  created  a website ,which consists of current
        students from different field or subjects so they can share about their course
        from scracth to placement. To join and support us use below link.
