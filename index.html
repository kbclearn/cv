    <h2>problem statement</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>1) there are many website like www.tutorialduniya.com , www.finalrevise.com 
        and quora ,they all talk about the course content and scope but this is not 
        sufficent because  after complettion of class 12 many student have not clear
        vission about what to do next even if they certain plans then they find it
        hard where to apply and when to fill forms 
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        to solve this problem we have  created  a website ,which consists of current
        students from different field or subjects so they can share about their course
        from scracth to placement. To join and support us use below link.
